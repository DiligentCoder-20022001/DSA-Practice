### InterviewPrep + Constant Revision + Future Plans

```
Time Complexity Analysis (Reference)
Maximum Complexity which can be handled by compiler will be O(10^6) 
0. So in case of O(n) solution -> constraints will be n <= 10^6 
1. So in case of O(n) solution -> constraints will be n <= 10^6 
2. In case of O(n^2) solution -> constraints will be n <= 10^3 as (10^3 * 10^3 == 10^6)
Similiarly with others-> all you have to do is just substitute the value of n in the worst case complexity!!

### The DSA Plan

- Blind 75 List [15 days] -> Finish by Dec
- Finish Striver's Tree and Trie series + new SDE Sheet added problems (in Striver Sheet Repo)
- Codechef (DSA Learning Series) + Codeforces (a20j ladders) -> Start from Dec and keep doing constantly in free time
- Start contests on Leetcode from Dec + contests on CF once confident (to an extent atleast) in CP 

### The Dev Plan
- Study
   - Java Basics 
   - OOPS and Exception handling 
   - JDBC 
   - Servlets 
   - Spring, Springboot 
   - Dependency Injection
- Study Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Azure certification
- Revise DBMS, JS, React and familiarize both frontend and backend dev
- High level design after which low level design
- Pair programming of Youtube Projects first and then improvise on it 
- One final big project if time permits

### Timeline 
1. Dec 9 - Dec 12 -> DSA using Java & Javascript revision (frontend and backend) 
2. Dec 13 - Dec 31 -> Java Based Dev with DBMS (Hari -> Watch DBMS videos) 
3. Jan 1 - Jan 7 -> Cloud (AWS)
4. Jan 11 - Jan 17 -> To be confirmed
