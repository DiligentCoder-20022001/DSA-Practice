# InterviewPrep

Practice questions from GFG, Leetcode, Codechef and Codeforces

```
Write it here!

Maximum Complexity which can be handled by compiler will be O(10^6) 

1. So in case of O(n) solution -> constraints will be n <= 10^6 
2. In case of O(n^2) solution -> constraints will be n <= 10^3 as (10^3 * 10^3 == 10^6)

Similiarly others -> all you have to do is substitute n in the worst case complexity!

# The Plan

- Blind 75 List [15 days] -> Finish by Oct
- Dev work/projects -> Oct-Dec
- Codechef (DSA Learning Series) + Codeforces (a20j ladders) -> Oct-Dec
- **Start giving contests on Codechef + Leetcode from Oct 1** -> Oct-Death ğŸ’€

[Add the Dev Plan later]
