```
Write it here!

Maximum Complexity which can be handled by compiler will be O(10^6) 

1.So in case of O(n) solution -> constraints will be n <= 10^6 
2. In case of O(n^2) solution -> constraints will be n <= 10^3 as (10^3 * 10^3 == 10^6)

Similiarly with others-> all you have to do is just substitute the value of n in the worst case complexity!!
