### InterviewPrep + Constant Revision + Future Plans

```
Time Complexity Analysis (Reference)
Maximum Complexity which can be handled by compiler will be O(10^6) 
0. So in case of O(n) solution -> constraints will be n <= 10^6 
1. So in case of O(n) solution -> constraints will be n <= 10^6 
2. In case of O(n^2) solution -> constraints will be n <= 10^3 as (10^3 * 10^3 == 10^6)
Similiarly with others-> all you have to do is just substitute the value of n in the worst case complexity!!

### The DSA Plan

- Blind 75 List [15 days] -> Finish by Dec
- Codechef (DSA Learning Series) + Codeforces (a20j ladders) -> Start from Dec and keep doing constantly in free time
- Start contests on Leetcode from Dec + contests on CF once confident (to an extent atleast) in CP 

### The Dev Plan
- Study
   - Java Basics 
   - OOPS and Exception handling 
   - JDBC 
   - Servlets 
   - Springboot 
- Study Kubernetes, Docker, AWS
- Revise JS, React and familiarize both frontend and backend dev
- Pair programming of Youtube Projects first and then improvise on it 
- One final big project if time permits

[@Sid - add any changes to the plan if necessary]
