### InterviewPrep + Constant Revision + Future Plans

```
Time Complexity Analysis (Reference)
Maximum Complexity which can be handled by compiler will be O(10^6) 
1. So in case of O(n) solution -> constraints will be n <= 10^6 
2. In case of O(n^2) solution -> constraints will be n <= 10^3 as (10^3 * 10^3 == 10^6)
Similiarly with others-> all you have to do is just substitute the value of n in the worst case complexity!!
```
### The DSA Plan

- Continue doing Striver SDE Sheet slowly (it's not a sprint, but a marathon)
- Watch all of Striver's playlists
- Start a2oj ladders and Codechef DSA Learning Series

### The Dev Plan
- Study
   - Java Basics 
   - OOPS and Exception handling 
   - JDBC 
   - Servlets 
   - Spring, Springboot 
   - Dependency Injection
- Learn DBMS and System Design parallely 
- Study Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Azure certification, Postman certification
