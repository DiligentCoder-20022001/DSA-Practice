# Problems I had to see the video explanation 

1. Longest consecutive sequence - Naive (nlogn) done but optimized code (linear) was not able to do
2. Longest Mountain In Array - Got the intution but could not do in one pass 
3. Subarray sort
4. Minimum swaps - totally new approach 
5. Array products - Similiar to trapping rain water
