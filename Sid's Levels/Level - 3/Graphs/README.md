# Problems I had to see the video solution 

1. Detect cycle in directed graph (DFS version)
2. Lexicographically smallest string - a new application of DFS/BFS problem
3. Clone Graph - Deep copy
4. Network Connection Problem -> Silly error -> Too much function calls were leading to TLE
5. Word Ladder - Optimized
